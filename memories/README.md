# CloneMe Memory System

> **üß† Intelligent long-term memory with quality filtering, deduplication, and smart cleanup**

## Overview

CloneMe's memory system creates persistent, meaningful memories of user interactions:
- **üéØ Quality-focused**: Saves only valuable long-term information
- **üö´ Deduplication**: Prevents redundant memory entries
- **üßπ Smart cleanup**: Importance-based memory management
- **üìä Categorization**: Organized memory storage by type
- **üîç Retrieval**: Context-aware memory recall for responses

## Memory Quality System

### What Gets Saved ‚úÖ

**High-Value Information:**
- **Core Identity**: Names, age, gender, pronouns
- **Stable Location**: Home location, origin country/city
- **Professional**: Career, job, education, skills
- **Relationships**: Family structure, relationship status, pets
- **Persistent Preferences**: Food likes/dislikes, hobbies, interests
- **Health/Dietary**: Allergies, dietary restrictions, health conditions
- **Goals/Plans**: Long-term goals, important upcoming events

**Example Messages That Create Memories:**
```
‚úÖ "My name is Sarah" ‚Üí name: Sarah
‚úÖ "I'm 28 years old" ‚Üí age: 28
‚úÖ "I work as a software engineer" ‚Üí profession: software engineer
‚úÖ "I live in Seattle" ‚Üí home_location: Seattle
‚úÖ "I'm allergic to peanuts" ‚Üí allergy: peanuts
‚úÖ "I have two kids" ‚Üí family: 2 children
```

### What Gets Rejected ‚ùå

**Low-Value Data:**
- **Temporary States**: "I'm tired", "I'm hungry", "I'm bored"
- **Questions/Requests**: "Where am I located?", "What's the weather?"
- **Meta-conversation**: "Do you remember...", "Can you tell me..."
- **Simple Reactions**: "ok", "thanks", "cool", "nice", "lol"
- **Weather/Current Events**: "It's raining", "Traffic is bad"

**Example Messages That Get Rejected:**
```
‚ùå "nothing just chilling in china bro" ‚Üí casual activity, no new info
‚ùå "Yo do you remember where im located ?" ‚Üí question about existing info
‚ùå "Can you tell me the weather today?" ‚Üí weather request
‚ùå "ok" ‚Üí simple acknowledgment
‚ùå "I'm tired" ‚Üí temporary state
```

## Memory Structure

### Memory Entry Format

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-06-12T04:41:50.325360+00:00",
  "category": "personal_info",
  "data": {
    "name": "Aiden Shen",
    "location": "China"
  },
  "importance": "high",
  "source": "User message: My name is Aiden and I live in China"
}
```

### Memory Categories

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `personal_info` | Core identity and basic info | Name, age, location, occupation |
| `preferences` | Likes, dislikes, interests | Food preferences, hobbies, music |
| `relationships` | Family, friends, romantic | "I have a sister", "My dog Max" |
| `professional` | Work, education, skills | Job title, education, expertise |
| `health` | Medical, dietary, physical | Allergies, diet restrictions |
| `goals` | Plans, aspirations, events | "Learning Spanish", "Getting married" |

### Importance Levels

| Level | Description | Retention | Examples |
|-------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| `high` | Core identity, permanent traits | Highest priority | Name, age, profession, allergies |
| `medium` | Preferences, relationships | Medium priority | Hobbies, family info, goals |
| `low` | Temporary or less critical | Lowest priority | Casual mentions, minor preferences |

## Deduplication System

### Duplicate Detection

The system prevents redundant memories through multiple checks:

1. **Exact Match Detection**
   ```json
   Existing: {"location": "China"}
   New: {"location": "China"}
   Result: ‚ùå Rejected as duplicate
   ```

2. **Similar Value Detection**
   ```json
   Existing: {"name": "John Smith"}
   New: {"name": "john smith"}
   Result: ‚ùå Rejected as duplicate (case-insensitive)
   ```

3. **Category Overlap**
   ```json
   Existing: {"current_location": "Tokyo"}
   New: {"location": "Tokyo"}
   Result: ‚ùå Rejected as duplicate (same location, different key)
   ```

### Meta-Information Filtering

The system automatically rejects meta-information that doesn't represent actual user data:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[New Memory Candidate] --> B{Contains Meta-Info?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Check Patterns]
    C --> D{Matches Meta Pattern?}
    D -->|Yes| E[‚ùå Reject Memory]
    D -->|No| F[‚úÖ Continue Processing]
    B -->|No| F

    G[Meta Patterns] --> H["current_location_query"]
    G --> I["location_request"]
    G --> J["weather_request"]
    G --> K["asking", "wondering"]
```

### Memory Consolidation

When similar information is found, the system consolidates instead of duplicating:

```json
// Before
{
  "data": {"location": "China"},
  "timestamp": "2025-06-10T04:41:50Z",
  "importance": "medium"
}

// New information: "I'm from China originally"
// After consolidation
{
  "data": {"location": "China", "origin": "China"},
  "timestamp": "2025-06-12T04:41:50Z",  // Updated to latest
  "importance": "high"  // Upgraded importance
}
```

## Smart Cleanup System

### Cleanup Algorithm

When memory limit is reached (50 memories), the system uses intelligent cleanup:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Memory Limit Reached] --> B[Calculate Memory Scores]
    B --> C[Score = Importance + Recency]
    C --> D[Sort by Score]
    D --> E[Keep Top 50 Memories]
    E --> F[Remove Low-Score Memories]
```

### Scoring Formula

```
Memory Score = Importance Weight + Recency Score

Importance Weights:
- high: 3 points
- medium: 2 points  
- low: 1 point

Recency Score:
- Recent memories: Up to 1 additional point
- Older memories: Gradually decreasing score
- 1 year old: 0 additional points
```

### Example Cleanup Decision

```
Memory A: high importance, 1 day old ‚Üí Score: 3 + 0.99 = 3.99
Memory B: medium importance, 1 week old ‚Üí Score: 2 + 0.98 = 2.98
Memory C: low importance, 1 month old ‚Üí Score: 1 + 0.92 = 1.92

Result: Memory C gets removed first
```

## Memory Retrieval

### Context-Aware Retrieval

When generating responses, the system:

1. **Analyzes current conversation** for relevant topics
2. **Searches memories** for matching content
3. **Scores relevance** based on context similarity
4. **Selects top memories** for inclusion
5. **Formats for AI** with clear context markers

### Retrieval Example

```
User: "What's my favorite food?"

Memory Search Results:
‚úÖ {"food_preference": "Italian cuisine"} - High relevance
‚úÖ {"allergy": "peanuts"} - Medium relevance  
‚ùå {"location": "China"} - Low relevance

AI Context: "User prefers Italian cuisine and is allergic to peanuts"
```

## API Reference

### Memory Operations

```python
# Check if memory should be saved
should_save, reasoning = decision.should_save_memory(
    target_message=message,
    person=sender,
    platform_prefix="discord"
)

# Retrieve relevant memories
memories, reasoning = decision.retrieve_relevant_memories(
    target_message=message,
    person=sender,
    platform_prefix="discord"
)
```

### Memory File Operations

```python
# Memory files are automatically managed
# Location: memories/{platform}_{user_id}.json

# Example file: memories/discord_1234567890.json
{
  "user_id": "1234567890",
  "platform": "discord", 
  "created_at": "2025-06-10T04:41:50.325360+00:00",
  "last_updated": "2025-06-12T04:43:41.924782+00:00",
  "memories": [
    // Array of memory entries
  ]
}
```

## Memory Analytics

### Quality Metrics

The system tracks memory quality through:
- **Acceptance Rate**: % of analyzed messages that create memories
- **Deduplication Rate**: % of potential memories rejected as duplicates
- **Cleanup Frequency**: How often memory limits are reached
- **Retrieval Relevance**: How often retrieved memories are used in responses

### Performance Monitoring

```bash
# Check memory system performance in logs
grep "Memory Analysis" logs/*/platform_manager.log
grep "üíæ" logs/*/platform_manager.log

# Example log entries:
üíæ Memory Analysis: Saved new info
üß† Memory Reasoning: High-value personal information detected
üîÑ Updated existing memory for user 1234567890: personal_info
üö´ Rejected low-quality memory: weather request
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Too many memories being saved**
   ```bash
   # Check quality filtering in logs
   grep "Rejected" logs/*/platform_manager.log
   
   # Adjust quality thresholds if needed
   ```

2. **Important information not being saved**
   ```bash
   # Check memory analysis reasoning
   grep "Memory Reasoning" logs/*/platform_manager.log
   
   # Verify information meets quality criteria
   ```

3. **Memory file corruption**
   ```bash
   # Validate JSON format
   python -m json.tool memories/discord_1234567890.json
   
   # Check for backup files
   ls memories/*.backup
   ```

### Best Practices

- **Monitor logs** for memory system performance
- **Review memory files** periodically for accuracy
- **Adjust quality settings** based on your needs
- **Backup important memory files** before major changes
